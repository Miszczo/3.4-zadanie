          I don't want to set the world on fire, <br> I just want to start a flame in your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my heart I have but one desire, <br> And that one is you No other will do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've lost all AMbition for worldly acclaim, <br> I just want to be the one you love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And with your admission that you feel the same, <br> I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of believe me.
